	abstract = {Since its experimental discovery, many phenomenological theories successfully reproduced the rapid rise of the Hall number nH, going from p at low doping to 1+p at the critical doping p∗ of the pseudogap in superconducting cuprates. Further comparison with experiments is now needed in order to narrow down candidates. In this paper, we consider three previously successful phenomenological theories in a unified formalism—an antiferromagnetic mean field (AF), a spiral incommensurate antiferromagnetic mean field (sAF), and the Yang-Rice-Zhang (YRZ) theory. We find a rapid rise in the specific heat and a rapid drop in the Seebeck coefficient for increasing doping across the transition in each of those models. The predicted rises and drops are locked, not to p∗, but to the doping where antinodal electron pockets, characteristic of each model, appear at the Fermi surface shortly before p∗. While such electron pockets are still to be found in experiments, we discuss how they could provide distinctive signatures for each model. We also show that the range of doping where those electron pockets would be found is strongly affected by the position of the van Hove singularity.},

Below p☆, both coefficients exhibit an upturn at low temperature, which gets more pronounced with decreasing p. Taken together, these upturns show that the normal-state carrier density n at T=0 drops upon entering the pseudogap phase. Quantitatively, it goes from n=1+p at p=0.24 to n=p at p=0.20. By contrast, the mobility does not change appreciably, as revealed by the magnetoresistance. Our data are in excellent agreement with recent high-field data on YBa2Cu3Oy and La2−xSrxCuO4. The quantitative consistency across three different cuprates shows that a drop in carrier density from 1+p to p is a universal signature of the pseudogap transition at T=0. We discuss the implication of these findings for the nature of the pseudogap phase.},

Against a backdrop of mounting evidence for anisotropic single-particle lifetimes in cuprate superconductors, new results have emerged that advocate similar momentum dependence in the transport decay rate Γ( k ). In addition, enhancement of the energy scale (up to the bare bandwidth) over which spectroscopic information on the quasiparticle response can be obtained has led to the discovery of new, unforeseen features that, surprisingly, may have a significant bearing on the transport properties at the dc limit. With these two key developments in mind, I consider here whether all the ingredients necessary for a complete phenomenological description of the anomalous normal state transport properties of high- T c cuprates are now in place.},

Many other aspects have been revealed exhibiting both their similarities and differences with the hole-doped compounds. This review summarizes the current experimental status of these materials. This information is synthesized into a consistent view on a number of topics important to both this material class and the overall cuprate phenomenology including the phase diagram, the superconducting order-parameter symmetry, electron-phonon coupling, phase separation, the nature of the normal state, the role of competing orders, the spin-density wave mean-field description of the normal state, and pseudogap effects.},

Its connection to the Mott insulator phase at low doping (hole concentration, p) remains ambiguous and its relation to the charge order that reconstructs the Fermi surface at intermediate doping is still unclear. Here we use measurements of the Hall coefficient in magnetic fields up to 88 tesla to show that Fermi-surface reconstruction by charge order in the cuprate YBa2Cu3Oy ends sharply at a critical doping p = 0.16 that is distinctly lower than the pseudogap critical point p* = 0.19 (ref. 11). This shows that the pseudogap and charge order are separate phenomena. We find that the change in carrier density n from n = 1 + p in the conventional metal at high doping (ref. 12) to n = p at low doping (ref. 13) starts at the pseudogap critical point. This shows that the pseudogap and the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator are linked.},

              x
              = 0.15–0.17) by quantum oscillation measurements (QOM). This is all the more puzzling because neutron scattering suggests that the antiferromagnetic (AFM) long-range order, which is believed to reconstruct the FS, vanishes before
              x
              = 0.14. To reconcile the conflict, a widely discussed external magnetic-field–induced AFM long-range order in QOM explains the FS reconstruction as an extrinsic property. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) evidence of FS reconstruction in optimal- and overdoped NCCO. The observed FSs are in quantitative agreement with QOM, suggesting an intrinsic FS reconstruction without field. This reconstructed FS, despite its importance as a basis to understand electron-doped cuprates, cannot be explained under the traditional scheme. Furthermore, the energy gap of the reconstruction decreases rapidly near
